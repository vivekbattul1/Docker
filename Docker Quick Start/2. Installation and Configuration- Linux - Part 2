2. Installation and Configuration: Linux â€” Part 2:
==================================================

there is always more than one way to perform a task on Linux. Scripts for this installation can be found at:

https://get.docker.com

and

https://github.com/docker/docker-install


Following are the command to install docker using script:

$wget -qO- https://get.docker.com |sh

$ sudo systemctl enable docker

Start Docker with the systemctl start command:
$ sudo systemctl start docker

For best practices, do not use root. Instead, add your user to the Docker group. For this example, our user is named user:
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker user

Once finished, log out and then log back in for changes to take effect.
