9. Redirection: Docker Container Ports:
========================================
we will learn about Docker ports. While we will discuss Docker specifically, the concepts we'll learn in this apply to every container technology. 
By exposing ports, we can create internal connections to locally hosted applications and then, when we're ready, publish those ports to make the connection available to the outside world.

Note: if any rpms, such as elinks, need to be installed, use 'yum install $rpm_name' to install it.


To run a container with detached mode:
--------------------------------------
$ docker container run -d nginx   //  -d option is detached mood it runs the container in background and it gives your shell to use 

it exposes port 80 bydefault because of nginx image and it is accesslible only locally or for that server only

To take container IP using below command:
-----------------------------------------
$ docker container instpect <containerID> | grep IPAdd

to get this ip and check the connection is happend or not

$ elinks <ipaddress>:80





To expose port to world its mapped random system port to 80 port on container:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ docker container run -d -P nginx        // -P option is to open port to world and its mapped the random port to container port 80(depends on service)


To expose port 80 to world and mapped port 80 on container:
-----------------------------------------------------------
$ docker container run -d -p 80:80 httpd     // -p option is mapped 80 and expose to world and port map to container port 80
