5. The Dockerfile:
==================
Docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile -- a text file that contains all commands, in order, needed to build a given image. A Dockerfile adheres to a specific format and set of instructions which you can find at Dockerfile reference.

A Docker image consists of read-only layers each of which represents a Dockerfile instruction. The layers are stacked and each one is a delta of the changes from the previous layer.


Dockerfile best practices can be found at:
https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#pipe-dockerfile-through-stdin


To create a simple Dockerfile and build an Image:
-------------------------------------------------

step 1: create a simple file give name as Dockerfile
-------
$ vim Dockerfile    // write your dockerfile here we build simple ubuntu image and install python on top of that base image
----------------
FROM ubuntu:16.04
LABEL maintainer="vivekb@acc.ltd"
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python3

:wq   // save and exit from vim editor

Each instruction creates one layer:
------------------------------------
FROM creates a layer from the ubuntu:16.04 Docker image.
LABEL its just tag a label to give information
RUN builds your application with make.



below command build the docker image from the docker file
$ docker build .

To check images use below command
$ docker images
