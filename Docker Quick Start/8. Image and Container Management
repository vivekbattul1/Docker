----------------------------------
$ docekr container rm <container id or name>
$ docker container rm <continerid> <container name>   // you can remove multiple continer at a time


To remove docker images you
============================  
Note: you need to stop the container which refer the image other wise it will not remove
$ docker rmi <imageID> 



To tag and push custom images to docker hub :
--------------------------------------

$ docker login
username:
password:

$ docker tag <imageid> <dockerid>/<imagename what you want>:<tagname>
$ docker tag 73849300 vivekbattul1/onboarding:v1

$ docker push vivekbattul1/onboarding


To pull our image from docker hub:
